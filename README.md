# Kenya Energy Forecasting Analysis

Analysis and machine learning models for forecasting Kenya's renewable energy generation using wind turbine and hydropower data.

## Notebooks

- **`kenyaEnergyAnalysis.ipynb`** - Comprehensive analysis of Kenya's electricity sector (2000-2024), exploring generation sources, consumption patterns, and supply-demand balance using International Energy
Agency data.

- **`renewableEnergyForecasting.ipynb`** - Machine learning pipeline for predicting renewable energy output using Random Forest models with Bayesian optimization. Covers wind turbine power forecasting and hydropower
inflow prediction.

## Data Sources

- International Energy Agency (IEA) electricity statistics
- Wind turbine operational data (SDWPF dataset)
- European hydropower inflow data (ENTSO-E, JRC)

## Key Findings

- Kenya generates 90%+ of electricity from renewable sources (2024)
- Wind power forecasting achieves 79% accuracy using weather and temporal features
- Hydropower inflow can be predicted with 80% accuracy using meteorological data
